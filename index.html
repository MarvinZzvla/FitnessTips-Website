          <h2 class="home-headline-1">Why it is important to exercise</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph">
            Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost
            your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your
            tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently.
            And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to
            tackle daily chores.While exercising causes the body to produce
            chemicals that help a person feel good. It can assist people to
            sleep better.

          <h2 class="home-headline">Exercise</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph">
            Exercise is a cornerstone of health and benefits nearly every system
            in the body. Many of the benefits are seen immediately, like reduced
            anxiety, lowered blood pressure, and better sleep. Consistent
            exercise offers even more long term benefits, including better
            weight management, stronger bones, and a reduced risk of more than
            35 diseases. High intensity exercise decreases appetite, often for
            at least 30 to 60 minutes after finishing a workout. Physical
            activity can also help you feel more satisfied and full after a
            meal. Unfortunately, sedentary activities appear to have the
            opposite effect. Research has shown that people who spend more time
            watching television consume more calories and are more likely to be
            overweight.

          <h2 class="home-headline">Diet</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph">
            Diet and nutrition affect virtually all aspects of our health.
            Eating a healthy, balanced diet has been shown to reduce the risk of
            a myriad of health conditions, from heart disease and stroke, to
            diabetes and obesity. Diet can also affect our mental health, with
            several studies suggesting that certain diets may reduce the risk of
            developing depression and anxie Food can either fuel or foil a
            workout, and research shows that combining a healthy diet with
            adequate exercise offers more benefits than improving diet alone.
            The right combination of fluids, carbohydrates and protein, eaten at
            the right time, can improve athletic performance and decrease
            fatigue. Poor dietary choices, like eating right before a
            high-intensity cardio workout, can lead to increased nausea and make
            exercise more challenging.
          </p>
          <h2 class="home-headline">Sleep</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph">
            Sleep offers the body and brain time to restore and recover,
            affecting nearly every tissue in the body. According to the National
            Sleep Foundation, most adults need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep,
            yet almost one third of Americans are getting less than 6 hours per
            night. Sleep deprivation increases the risk of health conditions
            like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prolonged sleep
            deprivation can also affect concentration and other cognitive
            functions. Without enough sleep, people tend to overeat and choose
            unhealthy foods. Sleep deprivation affects the bodyâ€™s release of
            ghrelin and leptin, two neurotransmitters that tell our brain when
            to consume calories. People who are sleep deprived are more drawn
            towards high-calorie foods. Chronic sleep loss has been linked to
            having a larger waist circumference, and an increased risk of
            obesity.
