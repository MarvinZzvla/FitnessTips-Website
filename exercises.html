          <p class="exercise-paragraph">
            <span>To do a pushup:</span> <br />Place the palms on the floor
            under the shoulders, arms extended.<br />
            Extend the legs back, resting on the balls of the feet, so the body
            is a straight line. <br />Lower the body, so that the chest or nose
            is about to touch the floor. Push back up. <br />Repeat this 10
            times or as many times as possible before tiring. <br />Take a
            break, then do this set again. If this is too difficult, begin by
            resting on the knees instead of stretching the legs out. Over time,
            work up to the pushup described above.

          <h2 class="exercise-headline">Squats</h2>

          />
          <p class="exercise-paragraph">
            <span>To do a squat:</span> <br />Your feet should be between hip-
            and shoulder-width distance apart, with your toes slightly turned
            out (between 5 and 15 degrees). <br />Your spine should be neutral,
            shoulders back, chest open.<br />
            Make sure you keep your heels down and keep them planted throughout
            the move. <br />You can clasp hands in front of chest for balance.
            Initiate the movement by sending the hips back as if you’re sitting
            back into an invisible chair. <br />Bend knees to lower down as far
            as possible with chest lifted in a controlled movement. Keep lower
            back neutral. Press through heels to stand back up to starting
            position. Repeat.
          </p>

          <h2 class="exercise-headline">Rowing</h2>
          <img

          />
          <p class="exercise-paragraph">
            <span>To do a rowing:</span> <br />Grab the dumbbell with one hand
            supporting the knee and palm the other hand on a bench. <br />The
            back must be immobilized and the arm that holds the dumbbell must be
            extended to the side of the body.<br />
            In this position, inhale and raise the dumbbell towards your back
            while keeping your arm parallel to your body. <br />Try to bring
            your elbow back, as if you were imitating the movement of the oar.
            <br />Exhale, slowly lower the dumbbell and return to the starting
            position.
          </p>

          <h2 class="exercise-headline">Pull Ups</h2>
          <img
            alt="pullups"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8beb99d0-e54b-488d-9fd9-81e688d2e6ec/pullups.jpg?v=1653193111417"
          />
          <p class="exercise-paragraph">
            <span>To do a pull ups:</span><br />Start by standing directly below
            a pull-up bar. <br />Place your hands in an overhand grip (palms
            facing away from your body) with your hands slightly further than
            shoulder-width apart. If you can’t reach the bar from standing on
            the floor, you can place a box beneath you and stand on that.
            <br />Once your hands are holding onto the bar, you’re in your
            starting position.<br />
            Inhale, then exhale. <br />Lift your feet up from the floor or box
            so that you’re hanging from the bar, and engage your core by pulling
            your belly button in toward your spine.<br />
            Pull your shoulders back and down. Engaging the muscles in your arms
            and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the
            bar until your chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your
            elbows toward your hips if that makes the movement easier. <br />As
            you move, avoid swinging your legs around or shrugging your
            shoulders up. <br />You want to make sure your shoulder blades
            remain back and down throughout the exercise. At the top of the
            movement, inhale. Then extend your elbows and lower your body back
            down to the starting position.

          <h2 class="exercise-headline">Run / Jogging</h2>
          <img
            alt="run"

          <p class="exercise-paragraph">
            Run or Jogging The difference between running and jogging is
            intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more
            effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running
            requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging. Both
            running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means
            'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic exercise' means any physical
            activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose
            or body fat.
