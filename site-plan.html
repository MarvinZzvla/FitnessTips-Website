      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever been in a moment where you say you should improve your
        health but you don't know how? Do you think about joining a gym but you
        feel unsure about what you are going to do?<br />
        The purpose of this site is to learn how to improve our health through
        the best exercises, diet and rest. With the lack of time today, we must
        learn what is best for us and how to correctly perform these exercises
        to improve our physical condition. It is normal that we feel insecure
        the first time we go to the gym or train from home about what exercises
        we should do, it is not as simple as: I want bigger arms? Then I'll do
        arm exercises. The exercises must be compound and for your whole body.
        Here you will learn about the principles of good health and some
        exercises that you can do at the gym or at home.

        Why it is important to exercise<br />
        Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost
        your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues
        and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when
        your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily
        chores.While exercising causes the body to produce chemicals that help a
        person feel good. It can assist people to sleep better.<br />
        Exercise<br />
        Exercise is a cornerstone of health and benefits nearly every system in
        the body. Many of the benefits are seen immediately, like reduced
        anxiety, lowered blood pressure, and better sleep. Consistent exercise
        offers even more long term benefits, including better weight management,
        stronger bones, and a reduced risk of more than 35 diseases.<br />
        High intensity exercise decreases appetite, often for at least 30 to 60
        minutes after finishing a workout. Physical activity can also help you
        feel more satisfied and full after a meal. Unfortunately, sedentary
        activities appear to have the opposite effect. Research has shown that
        people who spend more time watching television consume more calories and
        are more likely to be overweight.<br />
        Diet Diet and nutrition affect virtually all aspects of our health.
        Eating a healthy, balanced diet has been shown to reduce the risk of a
        myriad of health conditions, from heart disease and stroke, to diabetes
        and obesity. Diet can also affect our mental health, with several
        studies suggesting that certain diets may reduce the risk of developing
        depression and anxie<br />
        Food can either fuel or foil a workout, and research shows that
        combining a healthy diet with adequate exercise offers more benefits
        than improving diet alone. The right combination of fluids,
        carbohydrates and protein, eaten at the right time, can improve athletic
        performance and decrease fatigue. Poor dietary choices, like eating
        right before a high-intensity cardio workout, can lead to increased
        nausea and make exercise more challenging.<br />
        Sleep<br />
        Sleep offers the body and brain time to restore and recover, affecting
        nearly every tissue in the body. According to the National Sleep
        Foundation, most adults need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep, yet almost
        one third of Americans are getting less than 6 hours per night. Sleep
        deprivation increases the risk of health conditions like diabetes, heart
        disease, and stroke. Prolonged sleep deprivation can also affect
        concentration and other cognitive functions.<br />
        Without enough sleep, people tend to overeat and choose unhealthy foods.
        Sleep deprivation affects the bodyâ€™s release of ghrelin and leptin, two
        neurotransmitters that tell our brain when to consume calories. People
        who are sleep deprived are more drawn towards high-calorie foods.
        Chronic sleep loss has been linked to having a larger waist
        circumference, and an increased risk of obesity.<br />

        5 Better Exercises to start<br />
        Push Up<br />
        To do a pushup: Place the palms on the floor under the shoulders, arms
        extended. Extend the legs back, resting on the balls of the feet, so the
        body is a straight line. Lower the body, so that the chest or nose is
        about to touch the floor. Push back up. Repeat this 10 times or as many
        times as possible before tiring. Take a break, then do this set again.
        If this is too difficult, begin by resting on the knees instead of
        stretching the legs out. Over time, work up to the pushup described
        above.<br />
        Squats<br />
        To do a squat: Your feet should be between hip- and shoulder-width
        distance apart, with your toes slightly turned out (between 5 and 15
        degrees). Your spine should be neutral, shoulders back, chest open. Make
        sure you keep your heels down and keep them planted throughout the move.
        You can clasp hands in front of chest for balance. Initiate the movement
        by sending the hips back as if youâ€™re sitting back into an invisible
        chair. Bend knees to lower down as far as possible with chest lifted in
        a controlled movement. Keep lower back neutral. Press through heels to
        stand back up to starting position. Repeat.<br />
        Rowing<br />
        To do a rowing: Grab the dumbbell with one hand supporting the knee and
        palm the other hand on a bench. The back must be immobilized and the arm
        that holds the dumbbell must be extended to the side of the body. In
        this position, inhale and raise the dumbbell towards your back while
        keeping your arm parallel to your body. Try to bring your elbow back, as
        if you were imitating the movement of the oar. Exhale, slowly lower the
        dumbbell and return to the starting position.<br />
        Pull Ups<br />
        To do a pull ups: Start by standing directly below a pull-up bar. Place
        your hands in an overhand grip (palms facing away from your body) with
        your hands slightly further than shoulder-width apart. If you canâ€™t
        reach the bar from standing on the floor, you can place a box beneath
        you and stand on that. Once your hands are holding onto the bar, youâ€™re
        in your starting position. Inhale, then exhale. Lift your feet up from
        the floor or box so that youâ€™re hanging from the bar, and engage your
        core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Pull your
        shoulders back and down. Engaging the muscles in your arms and back,
        bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your
        chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your elbows toward your
        hips if that makes the movement easier. As you move, avoid swinging your
        legs around or shrugging your shoulders up. You want to make sure your
        shoulder blades remain back and down throughout the exercise. At the top
        of the movement, inhale. Then extend your elbows and lower your body
        back down to the starting position. <br />
        Run / Jogging <br />
        Run or Jogging The difference between running and jogging is intensity.
        Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the
        heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level
        of overall fitness than jogging. Both running and jogging are forms of
        aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' â€“ the term 'aerobic
        exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining
        oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.
